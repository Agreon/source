A shared components library for Guardian Digital. Uses the Guardian's [Source Design System](https://zeroheight.com/2a1e5182b).

## Usage

**This project is still in alpha.** If you'd like to start using our foundations and components, please drop an email to

### Install

### Develop

We develop components using Storybook:

```

### Publish

**1.** After merging your branch, our Storybook is automatically deployed to [GitHub pages](https://guardian.github.io/source-components). Storybook stories may used in our documentation site.

**2.** Run the publish script within the component (you will need to be a member of the [`@guardian` npm organisation](https://www.npmjs.com/settings/guardian/members)):

```
